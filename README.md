# socketprogram
These programs are for a server to host two clients using sockets. 
When one of the two clients meets certain requirements, the client that met the 
requirement will act as a client-server and wait for the other client to connect 
to it. The client-server will then receive data from the other client and display 
the data to the terminal. The other client will then diconnect, ending the program.
